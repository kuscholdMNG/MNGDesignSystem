# Color Tokens — Decision Log (through 2026-09-30)

> **Superseded for values (2026-09-24).** The current color values for every theme and site live in `mng-colors.tokens.json` in this folder (with `mng-colors.css` and `mng-colors-sites.csv`; engineering fixes are in `production-vs-design-differences.md` entry 21). Keep this file for the history: why tokens were added, renamed, removed or excluded. The newest decisions are in §8 and §9.
>
> **Changed since this was written:**
> - The export now includes The Baltimore Sun, Capital Gazette and `subsite-custom`, reversing the exclusions noted below. Those values come from the Figma style guides, not from Figma variables (Figma's Colors collection is capped at 20 modes).
> - Prairie Mountain Publishing (19 sites, including Greeley Tribune) is its own sub-theme: `modernearthy.css` + `site-pmp` color override. Since 2026-09-25 it is a Figma mode (it replaced the Greeley Tribune mode) and uses the Measured Vibrant should-be values. See §8.
> - The four collections described below (Theme, Brand, Primitives, Endless Tributes) were a first build. Their values now live in the MNG Design System file's single `Colors` collection (`3749:16`) and in the portable export.

**Status:** First built as four Figma variable collections (Theme, Brand, Primitives, Endless Tributes), now consolidated into the `Colors` collection — this doc is the durable reference for where each value came from.
**Source:** The pre-existing "Color Styles" Figma page (since retired). Every value below is sourced from the **left-hand list** in each site/theme Style Guide section (the "should-be"/target column), confirmed by reading each row's actual on-canvas x-position rather than relying on frame names or labels, since naming was inconsistent across sections.
**Excluded from source, per explicit decision:** The Baltimore Sun and Capital Gazette (no Style Guide data requested); `subsite-custom` (too sparse — only defined for a handful of sites, not being modeled as a formal variable).

## 1. Theme collection

Modes: Measured Vibrant, Bold Coastal, Modern Earthy.

**2026-08-27, corrected — no gap here after all.** An earlier note on this line claimed there are 4 shared default themes and that this collection was missing a mode for a "Morning Call" theme. That was wrong: a live check of mcall.com (the site people call "Morning Call") shows it loads `modernearthy.css` with its own color override on top via the WordPress Customizer, same as every other one-off site. There is no separate "Morning Call" theme file; it's a site name, not a 4th shared theme. This collection's 3 modes (Measured Vibrant, Bold Coastal, Modern Earthy) already cover every shared theme that actually exists — nothing to add here.

**Now checked, 2026-08-27:** mcall.com's own Brand-collection row (§2) was live-confirmed via the Customizer-scope check used platform-wide this date. Its live Customizer `primary` value came back as `#014B78`, which matches this doc's `primary-dark` for Morning Call (not `primary`, `#166291`) — see §2 and the note there for detail. (Greeley Tribune was checked the same day; see §8 for why it no longer has its own row.)

| Variable | Measured Vibrant | Bold Coastal | Modern Earthy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `color/theme/primary-lighter` | `#717FD1` | `#1799A5` | `#FE521E` |
| `color/theme/primary-light` | `#5869CA` | `#00838F` | `#E03400` |
| `color/theme/primary` | `#3F51B5` | `#007580` | `#CC3300` |
| `color/theme/primary-dark` | `#32408F` | `#0A5962` | `#B93611` |
| `color/theme/primary-darker` | `#171E44` | `#014A52` | `#A52804` |
| `color/theme/secondary` | `#EEFF41` | `#FFEA00` | `#EEFF41` |
| `color/theme/tertiary` | `#EB5300` | `#F4A700` | `#00828F` |
| `color/theme/near-black` | `#1F1E1C` | `#0A0908` | `#1A1A1A` |
| `color/theme/white` | `#FBFBFB` | `#FFFFFF` | `#FAFAFA` |

**Modern Earthy `tertiary`:** set to `#00828F` per your instruction, using the hex text as ground truth. Its rgb text on the source page was previously wrong (a typo, corrected — see §6) and unrelated to the sibling production row's `#FF5722`, which I'd mistakenly conflated with this row in an earlier pass.

**`color/theme/divider` removed.** It came from `card-teaser.md`'s live-site divider audit (Chicago Tribune/Orlando Sentinel = `#C8C4C0`, Denver Post/OC Register = `#D7D6D2`), mapped onto Measured Vibrant / Bold Coastal — but that doc itself flags this exact site pairing as inconsistent with other theme-based groupings found in the same audit, so modeling it as a clean theme-level token wasn't well-supported. Not bound to any component, so removing it was a clean delete. **Re-checked 2026-08-27 against the verified site/theme mapping** (Orlando Sentinel is Measured Vibrant with its own override; Denver Post is Bold Coastal with its own override, not the "bespoke" theme an earlier note claimed — see `card-teaser.md` §4.3) — the divider pairing still doesn't line up with real theme membership either way, so the removal decision stands, just for a corrected reason.

**~~Modern Earthy now has a live pilot site (Greeley Tribune, joined 2026-08-27)~~ Corrected 2026-09-24:** Greeley Tribune loads `modernearthy.css`, but its colors come from the PMP override plus its own div#page customizer values. It's a PMP site, not a Modern Earthy color reference. `color/theme/nav-text` is still unconfirmed on Modern Earthy sites (only typography has been audited so far). Worth confirming directly next time nav is in scope, per `navigation.md` §5.2.

## 2. Brand collection

17 modes (Chicago Tribune and Orange County Register use their theme's should-be values directly since they have no separate one-off Style Guide section; the other 15 have their own).

| Site | primary-lighter | primary-light | primary | primary-dark* | primary-darker | secondary | tertiary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chicago Tribune | `#717FD1` | `#5869CA` | `#3F51B5` | `#32408F` | `#171E44` | `#EEFF41` | `#EB5300` |
| Denver Post | `#C81632` | `#AF1628` | `#8E1024` | `#7D161E` | `#641614` | `#003459` | `#FFC518` |
| Orange County Register | `#1799A5` | `#00838F` | `#007580` | `#0A5962` | `#014A52` | `#FFEA00` | `#F4A700` |

| The Mercury News | `#A0D0ED` | `#007AB8` | `#006DA3` | `#006394` | `#00527A` | `#FFC518` | `#CD2709` |

| 21C Michigan Sites (Combined) | `#3E7CB2` | `#2A6496` | `#3A537A` | `#32476C` | `#2C3B55` | `#9DAABD` | `#FF5722` |
| ~~Greeley Tribune~~ **Prairie Mountain Publishing** (2026-09-25, §8) | `#717FD1` | `#5869CA` | `#3F51B5` | `#32408F` | `#171E44` | `#EEFF41` | `#EB5300` |

\* Renamed from `color/brand/primary-border` to `color/brand/primary-dark` (same values). It's the button hover fill and focus stroke color.

**Verification note:** every value above was re-checked directly against the left-hand-column position of its source row in Figma (not just against frame names/labels).

**Live-confirmed 2026-08-27 (Denver Post, Orlando Sentinel):** both sites' live-rendered `--primary` (read on the WordPress Customizer's actual scope rather than at `:root` — see `modal.md` for why that distinction matters) matches this table exactly: Denver Post `#8E1024`, Orlando Sentinel `#1776C4`.

**⚠️ Discrepancy found, mcall.com (2026-08-27):** live-rendered `--primary` on mcall.com is `#014B78` — that's an exact match for this table's **`primary-dark`** column for Morning Call, not `primary` (`#166291`). Either the site is live-rendering the wrong step of its own color ramp, or this table's column values are shifted for this row specifically. Not yet root-caused (production-vs-design entry 3).

## 3. Primitives collection — Universal Grays & Universal Alert Colors

Single "Value" mode. Source: "Shared Platform Reference — Style Guide" → "Universal Grays (Proposed — All Themes Should Use)" / "Universal Alert Colors".

| Variable | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `color/gray/black` | `#000000` | Source row is explicitly labeled "color-black (DO NOT USE)" — excluded last round, added back per your request. Use `gray/min` for new work. |
| `color/gray/min` | `#141414` | |
| `color/gray/100` | `#393938` | |
| `color/gray/200` | `#5E5D5C` | |
| `color/gray/300` | `#838280` | |
| `color/gray/400` | `#A7A6A3` | |
| `color/gray/500` | `#CCCAC7` | |
| `color/gray/600` | `#F1EFEB` | |
| `color/gray/max` | `#FFFFFF` | |
| `color/feedback/low-success` | `#2E8000` | Renamed from `color/feedback/low` (Karl, 2026-09-10). |
| `color/feedback/medium` | `#856A00` | |
| `color/feedback/high-error` | `#CC2B27` | Renamed from `color/feedback/high` (Karl, 2026-09-10). |

---

## 4. Endless Tributes collection

Single "Value" mode. Source: "Shared Platform Reference — Style Guide" → "Should-Be vs Production (per original UI Style Guide)" → "Endless Tributes — Updates."

**Mirrored into UI Style Guide, 2026-09-10:** all 9 of these colors now also exist in UI Style Guide's `Colors` collection (`VariableCollectionId:3749:16`) as a new `color/tributes/*` variable group, with the same value across all 20 modes rather than being squeezed into the existing 7-color-slot-per-theme pattern or modeled as a one-off theme mode. This reflects how obituary pages actually render in production — identically regardless of which site's masthead brand is active — so a single universal value per token is correct.

| Variable | Value | Production comparison |
|---|---|---|
| `color/tributes/primary-lighter` | `#F15F87` | Retired — not found live anywhere |
| `color/tributes/primary-light` | `#C00C3D` | Live match (`--primary-obit-light`) |
| `color/tributes/primary` ("Scarlet") | `#8D092D` | Live match (`--primary-obit`) |
| `color/tributes/primary-dark` | `#770000` | Retired — not found live anywhere |
| `color/tributes/primary-darker` | `#4D0000` | Retired — not found live anywhere |
| `color/tributes/secondary` ("Sage") | `#B3BC9C` | Live match, renamed to `--quaternary-obit` in production CSS |
| `color/tributes/tertiary` ("Brown") | `#3A252B` | Live match, hardcoded (no longer a variable) |
| `color/tributes/tan` | `#A39C8A` | Live match, hardcoded |
| `color/tributes/tan-light` | `#E8E6E2` | Drifted in production (`#ECEDE7`) |

## 5. Resolved this round

1. **`color/brand/primary-border` → `color/brand/primary-dark`.** It wasn't just a naming leftover — it's the button hover fill and focus stroke color. Renamed rather than deleted.
2. **`color/gray/black` (`#000000`) added** to Primitives, with a description noting the source flags it "DO NOT USE" and that `gray/min` is preferred for new work.
3. **Modern Earthy `tertiary` set to `#00828F`** (the literal left-hand hex text), per your explicit instruction — overriding my earlier recommendation of `#FF5722`.

## 6. Hex vs. RGB audit (source page data quality)

Scanned all 333 color rows across every section of the Color Styles page for hex/rgb text mismatches. Found 3, all in Modern Earthy's should-be block (`Frame 1 > Modern Earthy — Theme Default — Brand / Primary (should-be)`) — no other theme, one-off site, or shared-reference section had any. In every case the hex text was treated as correct, and the rgb text on the Color Styles page itself was corrected to match:

| Variable | Hex (correct, unchanged) | RGB text — before | RGB text — after |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--primary-lighter` | `#FE521E` | `rgb(254, 82, 29)` | `rgb(254, 82, 30)` |
| `--primary-darker` | `#A52804` | `rgb(65, 40, 4)` | `rgb(165, 40, 4)` |
| `--tertiary` | `#00828F` | `rgb(130, 143, 100)` | `rgb(0, 130, 143)` |

No Figma Variable values changed as a result of this fix — the variables were already built from the hex text. This was purely a correction to the reference page's rgb labels.

## 7. CRUX Style Library color comparison: decisions (2026-09-10)

Carried over from `CRUX-Gap-Analysis.md`, which was retired on 2026-09-24. All of its color values are already in `mng-colors.tokens.json` or `production-vs-design-differences.md`. Only these decisions were found nowhere else:

1. **CRUX's semantic role tokens are not adopted.** That covers `color/text/*`, `color/background/*`, `color/border/*`, `color/action/subscribe/*`, `color/breadcrumb/active` and `color/gray/footer`.
2. **CRUX's component-level color tokens are not adopted.** That covers `component/button/*`, `component/focusRing/color`, `component/modal/backdrop` and `component/breakingBar/*`. MNG components bind directly to primitive and brand variables instead.
3. **CRUX's `grayRoot/100–600` scale is not adopted.** Production still uses it, which is logged as a production fix (production-vs-design entry 10).
4. **CRUX's `brown/100–400`, `brand/bgCommon` and obituary `secondaryObit` (`#946C82`) were skipped.**
5. **Color stays out of typography tokens.** CRUX bakes color into about 15 type styles; MNG keeps color and type separate.
6. **Publication coverage:**
   - "21C Michigan Sites (Combined)" covers The Oakland Press, Macomb Daily, The Morning Sun and The News-Herald.
   - Lowell Sun uses Modern Earthy as is.
   - NY Daily News uses Measured Vibrant plus a subsite override.
   - None of these three groups gets its own mode.
7. **Orange County Register was swapped out for South Florida Sun Sentinel** in the Figma Colors collection to stay within the 20-mode limit. OC Register uses the Bold Coastal values.
8. **Denver Post `primary-darker` typo fixed** to `#641614`.
9. **The Baltimore Sun and Capital Gazette are not Figma modes.** Their values live in the export. ~~Capital Gazette's design-vs-production mismatches were deliberately not logged.~~ Reversed 2026-09-25: every theme's mismatches are now logged (§8).

## 8. Greeley Tribune → Prairie Mountain Publishing; engineering callouts (2026-09-25)

1. **PMP uses the Measured Vibrant should-be values** (Karl). The PMP style guide's spec column (node `7027:37883`) was updated to them: `primary-lighter` `#717FD1`, `primary-light` `#5869CA`, `primary` `#3F51B5`, `primary-dark` `#32408F`, `primary-darker` `#171E44`, `secondary` `#EEFF41`, `tertiary` `#EB5300`. Neutrals stay `#1A1A1A` / `#FAFAFA` (nav-text `#1A1A1A`). PMP is still its own sub-theme, not Measured Vibrant: it loads `modernearthy.css` + `site-pmp`.
2. **The Greeley Tribune Figma mode became "Prairie Mountain Publishing"** (same mode ID `6857:12`, so any component bound to it now shows PMP). The mode count stays at 20. Its values were set to item 1.
3. **The Greeley Tribune — Style Guide section was deleted** from the Color Pallets page. Greeley stays listed under PMP's "Sites Using This Theme", with its `div#page` override (`primary` `#536E7F`, `primary-light` `#5B7B8B`, `primary-dark` `#44687F`) noted there. ~~Outlined in red as a site-level mismatch.~~ Changed 2026-09-30: it's a documented exception, not a mismatch (§9).
4. **Red-dashed outlines mark every production mismatch.** In PMP's production column, `primary-lighter` (not set, falls back to `#47B6FF`) and `tertiary` (`#303F9F`) were outlined, using the same stroke as Measured Vibrant.
5. **Every publication in the export lists its theme, sub-theme and fixes.** The Figma callouts are carried into `mng-colors.tokens.json` (`$extensions.com.mng.mismatches`), `mng-colors-sites.csv` (`engineering_fixes`) and the new `mng-colors-engineering-fixes.md` (merged into `production-vs-design-differences.md` entry 21 on 2026-09-30). This covers all 22 themes and sub-themes, Capital Gazette included.
6. ~~**The Baltimore Sun has no should-be spec**, so its tokens use its production values and no mismatches are listed. **Hartford Courant**'s parent theme file isn't recorded; both are flagged for follow-up.~~ Resolved in §9.

## 9. Greeley exception, Hartford Courant, The Baltimore Sun (2026-09-30)

1. **Greeley Tribune's overrides are a documented exception, not a mismatch** (Karl). Its `div#page` Customizer values (`primary` `#536E7F`, `primary-light` `#5B7B8B`, `primary-dark` `#44687F`) are intentional. In Figma the red outlines were removed and the values are noted under the PMP style guide's "Sites Using This Theme". In the export they're Greeley's site tokens (`$extensions.com.mng.exceptions` in the JSON, `site_overrides` in the CSV, a site block in the CSS). Engineering doesn't change them. Greeley still needs the two PMP-wide fixes (`primary-lighter`, `tertiary`).
2. **Hartford Courant runs Measured Vibrant** (verified live 2026-09-25). courant.com loads `measuredvibrant.css` + `plugins/site-plugins/site-tribune/dist/css/style.min.css`, with a `div#page` override setting `primary-light`, `primary` and `primary-dark` all to `#2B7EA5`. Everything else is inherited: `primary-lighter` `#47B6FF`, `primary-darker` `#171E44`, `secondary` `#EEFF41`, `tertiary` `#303F9F`. That matches the Figma style guide's production column, so its 6 callouts stand. It's now recorded as a sub-theme of Measured Vibrant (Figma style guide note, export and docs).
3. **The Baltimore Sun uses its documented Figma styles as is** (Karl). No should-be spec is needed and no production comparison is tracked, so it has no fixes and no follow-up.
4. **One Engineering handoff doc** (Karl). The per-theme fix list from `mng-colors-engineering-fixes.md` moved into `production-vs-design-differences.md` entry 21, and the separate file was retired. The rebuild script now writes entry 21 directly.
