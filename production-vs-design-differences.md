# Production vs. Design Differences — Engineering Handoff

> **Consolidated 2026-09-24.** Combines the Sept 22 version of this file (entries 1–17, unchanged except for the notes marked "2026-09-24") with a short duplicate created on Sept 24. That copy added one new item, now entry 18. Entry 19 and the method note at the end came from the HANDOFF and NOTE files in this folder. Entry 20 (icon font) was added 2026-09-25 from `components/icons.md`. Entry 21 (per-theme color fixes) was added 2026-09-25, when the Greeley Tribune color theme was folded into Prairie Mountain Publishing. Entries 18 and 21 were updated 2026-09-30 (Greeley exception, Hartford Courant verified) and 2026-10-01 (NEPA folded into the NEPA-PMP sub-theme; disputed sites verified live), and entry 21 now holds the full per-theme color fix list that used to be `tokens/colors/mng-colors-engineering-fixes.md` (retired). Notes for reading older entries:
> - `color-tokens.md` is now `tokens/colors/color-tokens-decision-log.md`. Current typography tokens are in `tokens/typography/typography-tokens.md`.
> - Greeley Tribune no longer has its own color theme or Figma mode (2026-09-25). Mentions of it below as a pilot site for layout, nav or typography still stand.

**Purpose:** A running list of every place live production has been found diverging from the Figma design-system spec, or where something was explicitly flagged as needing engineering (or legal) attention. Figma is the source of truth for these systems; when production disagrees, the fix belongs here as an engineering item rather than being silently absorbed into design tokens. Each entry says where the drift is, what Figma says vs. what's live, and what engineering should do about it.

**Status note:** This doc was referenced once before (in `MNG-Design-System-Status.md`, Known Open Items §5 item 3) but was never actually created — it was created 2026-09-10 during the typography consolidation work, backfilling that earlier reference plus the current typography section, then backfilled again the same day with every other open "flag to engineering" item found across the project's component/audit docs (card-teaser.md, modal.md, disclosure.md, navigation.md, containers-and-ad-units.md, color-tokens.md, Reader-Dashboard-Library-Impact-Map.md).

## 1. Buttons — Obituaries page CTA (Chicago Tribune, Denver Post)

**Found:** 2026-09-01, during the buttons audit.

**Figma spec:** Button Primary (main file, ***Buttons page), Default size — padding 16px vertical + 20px horizontal, 14px text.

**Production:** The live `.subscribe-button` CTA (249×44, confirmed identical on Chicago Tribune and Denver Post, also appears on regular article pages — a general paywall CTA, not obituary-specific) renders with padding 14px/10px instead of 16px/20px, and font-size 15px instead of 14px. Radius and per-masthead fill color already match Figma.

**Decision (Karl, 2026-09-01):** This is not a new button size/variant — it should simply carry Button Primary's existing Default styling. Production needs to be brought in line with Figma's padding and font-size values above; no new Figma token or variant should be created for it.

**Status:** Open.

---

## 2. Reader Dashboard — Typography (2026-09-10)

**Policy:** For anything specific to the Reader Dashboard, Figma is the source of truth — even where production currently differs. MNG Design System's `Dashboard/*` typography tokens (in the "Dashboard Typography" collection) are kept at their Figma-specified values; any place production has been found rendering something different is recorded here instead, for engineering to either fix in production or flag back to design if the production value should actually be adopted.

### 2.1 Page title size — `Dashboard/Titles/PageDesktop`

**Figma:** Noto Serif, **26px**, Bold (700) — matches Reader Dashboard v2.0's own Figma token (`Titles/Page (desktop, tabletH)`) exactly.

**Production:** canoncitydailyrecord.com/dashboard/ (desktop width) renders this title at **36px**, via a Tailwind `lg:text-4xl` breakpoint utility class overriding the base size.

**Action needed:** Reconcile production to the Figma-specified 26px, OR — if 36px is an intentional, approved change — get that confirmed with design so Figma can be updated to match and this item retired. Until then, MNG Design System's token stays at 26px per the policy above.

**Status:** Open.

### 2.2 Section Title weight — `Dashboard/Titles/SectionTitle`

**Figma:** Noto Sans, 18px, Bold (700).

**Production:** One live-measured instance showed weight 600 (Semi-Bold) instead of 700.

**Caveat (lower confidence than 2.1):** The measured instance may have been an admin/debug panel ("MNG Debugger" / "Entitlements JWT") rather than genuine reader-facing UI.

**Action needed:** Confirm on a real reader-facing Section Title instance whether it's 700 (matches Figma) or genuinely 600.

**Status:** Open.

### 2.3 `font/size/10` — unconfirmed in production

**Figma:** Defined at 10px in Reader Dashboard v2.0's Type Primitives, carried into MNG Design System.

**Production:** No confirmed live sighting during this audit (only canoncitydailyrecord.com/dashboard/ was checked).

**Action needed:** Low priority — confirm where (if anywhere) this size is actually used live.

**Status:** Open.

---

## 3. Color Tokens — mcall.com primary/primary-dark shift

**Found:** 2026-08-27, color token audit.

**Figma spec:** Brand collection, Morning Call mode — `primary` = `#166291`, `primary-dark` = `#014B78`.

**Production:** mcall.com's live-rendered `--primary` (read correctly, on the WordPress Customizer's actual scope) is `#014B78` — an exact match for the Figma table's `primary-dark`, not `primary`.

**Action needed:** Determine whether the site is live-rendering the wrong step of its own color ramp, or whether the Figma table's column values are shifted for this row specifically. Not root-caused.

**Note (2026-09-25):** Morning Call's full list of color fixes (6, including this one) is in entry 21.

**Status:** Open.

---

## 4. Article Card / Teaser

### 4.1 Denver Post — Section Highlight shows 4 headline items instead of 3

**Found:** Article Card / Teaser audit.

**Figma / platform norm:** Every pilot site (Chicago Tribune, OC Register, Orlando Sentinel, Greeley Tribune, mcall.com) shows exactly 3 headline items in the Section Highlight module.

**Production:** Denver Post shows 4 — and this isn't theme-scoped, since OC Register shares Denver Post's Bold Coastal theme but still shows 3.

**Action needed:** Confirm whether this is a deliberate per-site editorial choice or a real inconsistency worth fixing.

**Status:** Open — not yet root-caused.

### 4.2 Section title style (color, underline, sizing) doesn't match Figma on any of the 6 pilot sites

**Found:** Article Card / Teaser audit, §4.4 / Open Item 3.

**Figma spec (Karl's 2026-09-01 decision):** Section Highlight / "Latest Headlines" title — text color `color/gray/100`, a 2px underline in the site's own `--primary`, unified size/weight/letter-spacing per the eyebrow decision.

**Production:** None of the 6 pilot sites match the full spec. Text color is wrong on all 6. The underline itself doesn't exist at all on 4 of 6 sites (Chicago Tribune, Orlando Sentinel, OC Register, Denver Post) — only the 2 Modern Earthy sites have the underline mechanism, and only the 2 Bold Coastal sites match the size/weight.

**Action needed:** Ready to hand to engineering as a fully-specified spec to implement across all 6 sites.

> **Note (2026-09-24):** The "unified size/weight" part of this spec is out of date. On 2026-09-09 the single 20px eyebrow was replaced with per-theme eyebrow tokens: Bold Coastal 20/400/Sans, Measured Vibrant 17/700/Sans, Modern Earthy 21/400/Serif (see `tokens/typography/typography-decision-log.md`, decision 6). The color and underline parts of the spec still stand. Confirm the size/weight part with Karl before handing this to engineering.

**Status:** Open.

### 4.3 Responsive layout rules vary by container context (not fully mapped)

**Found:** Article Card / Teaser audit, §5 Open Item 8.

**Detail:** `feature-medium` and `headline-only` responsive (`flex-direction`) rules change depending on the parent container class (e.g. `.landing-four-up-hybrid`, `.landing-three-one`, `.slow .feature-top` each carry their own breakpoint overrides for the same classes). This overlaps with the upcoming Containers component and hasn't been fully mapped — flagging so it isn't mistaken for one universal rule.

**Status:** Open / informational — needs a dedicated mapping pass.

### 4.4 Excerpt/dek color needs re-verification (minor)

**Detail:** The dek/excerpt color (~`#484642`, sampled from Chicago Tribune) was derived via an rgb→hex rounding pass that wasn't double-checked the way other colors in the doc were.

**Status:** Open — low priority, worth a re-check before treating as final.

---

## 5. Reader Dashboard — Modal

**Figma source:** "ModalsCenter" library component, Reader Dashboard v2.0. **Live source:** East Bay Times preprod, account-verification flow.

### 5.1 Card border mismatch

Figma's ModalsCenter has a 1px `color/gray/300` border on the card; the live card was recorded relying on shadow only, with no border distinguished. Both may be true (a subtle border could be present but visually indistinguishable from the shadow) — not resolved either way.

**Status:** Open.

### 5.2 Backdrop opacity mismatch

Live backdrop is 45% black; the Figma-modeled value is 50% black — close, and not even built into the component as a literal property either way.

**Status:** Open — low priority.

### 5.3 Fixed 444px width, narrow-viewport behavior untested

The modal card is a fixed 444px, not fluid/responsive. Behavior at narrow viewports has not been tested.

**Status:** Open.

### 5.4 Password "Update" flow is unstyled design debt

Clicking "Update" for password doesn't open a modal — it navigates to a separate, essentially unstyled page (`/reset-password/`: Arial font, square corners, plain black button border, default gray input border) that matches none of the design system.

**Action needed:** This is design debt to flag, not a pattern worth capturing faithfully — needs a real design pass, not a Figma-matching exercise.

**Status:** Open.

### 5.5 Destructive-action modals unexplored

Only the account-verification modal was captured live. Other triggers (e.g. canceling a subscription) were deliberately not explored to avoid triggering irreversible account actions, so their modal spec is unconfirmed.

**Status:** Open — needs a human to click through and report back rather than automated exploration.

---

## 6. Reader Dashboard — Disclosure

### 6.1 Two competing disclosure/accordion patterns need reconciliation

Production's live Reader Dashboard (e.g. chicagotribune.com/user-tools/dashboard) uses a chevron/icon-based accordion pattern, different from the simpler text-link toggle documented from preprod (the pattern actually built in Figma). The chevron pattern is currently out of scope because that surface is being replaced — but if it survives the replacement, the two patterns will need to be reconciled into one.

**Status:** Open — contingent on what survives the Reader Dashboard replacement.

### 6.2 Coverage and behavior gaps

Only one instance of the disclosure pattern (Login Methods on Profile) was found and tested; other tabs (Subscription, Benefits, etc.) weren't checked for additional instances. Whether expand/collapse is animated or instant was never confirmed.

**Status:** Open.

---

## 7. Reader Dashboard — Design System Architecture

**Found:** Reader-Dashboard-Library-Impact-Map.md.

**Detail:** Modal, Disclosure, and Empty State/Status Badge had been rebuilt by hand as pilot copies instead of using Reader Dashboard v2.0's components, so they could drift out of sync.

**Resolved 2026-09-25:** the hand-built copies were retired. The sources are now the real components in the main file: ModalsCenter, Button Linkstyle and InLineMessage.

**Status:** Resolved.

---

## 8. Containers, Images & Ad Units

### 8.1 `object-fit: fill` on card images — distortion risk

Both hero and feature-medium images use `object-fit: fill` with no `aspect-ratio` set, meaning images are stretched to exactly fill their container rather than cropped-to-fill (`cover`). Distortion is currently minimal because sampled images happen to be close to the container's aspect ratio, but an editor uploading an off-ratio image would visibly stretch/squash it.

**Action needed:** Confirm with engineering whether `fill` is intentional or should be `cover`, since this is a live distortion risk on any off-ratio upload.

**Status:** Open.

### 8.2 Main content container width — Chicago Tribune vs. Denver Post

Chicago Tribune's `main` container measures 1260px at a 1280px viewport; Denver Post measures 1245px at the same viewport — a real 15px difference, not explained by Denver Post running a different theme (it doesn't — confirmed both load real shared theme stylesheets with their own Customizer overrides, same pattern as every other site).

**Status:** Open — not root-caused; could be a scrollbar-width artifact of that specific page load rather than a genuine CSS difference.

### 8.3 Orlando Sentinel — ad slots register lazily on mobile homepage

On Orlando Sentinel's mobile homepage, only the `mobile_adhesion` slot registered with Google Publisher Tag at initial load; the other 10 ad containers exist in the DOM but didn't register in `getSlots()` even after scrolling most of the page and waiting. This looks like Freestar (Orlando Sentinel's header-bidding wrapper, different from the other 5 pilot sites) registering slots lazily/progressively rather than upfront.

**Action needed:** Confirm with engineering whether this is expected Freestar behavior or worth a longer dwell-time re-check.

**Status:** Open.

### 8.4 No visible ad-disclosure label

No "Advertisement"/"Sponsored" text label or `aria-label` was found near any ad container on any of the 6 pilot sites — only Google's own AdChoices icon (rendered inside the ad iframe itself, not site-authored markup).

**Action needed:** Confirm with engineering/legal whether the absence of an explicit disclosure label at the container level is intentional, since AdChoices alone is a weaker disclosure than what many other publishers use.

**Status:** Open — legal/compliance relevance.

---

## 9. Navigation

### 9.1 Obituaries page — hamburger + "All Sections" both visible at desktop width

**Figma / platform rule:** On the homepage, the hamburger icon is only visible at ≤1039px.

**Production:** On the Obituaries page, at a comfortably-desktop viewport, both the hamburger icon and the "All Sections" button are visible simultaneously — confirmed on all 6 pilot sites (Chicago Tribune, Denver Post, OC Register, Orlando Sentinel, Greeley Tribune, mcall.com), including at a 1728px viewport.

**Action needed:** Still not explained — genuinely flagged to engineering to confirm whether this is intentional for the Obituaries template or a bug.

**Status:** Open.

### 9.2 Cross-site avatar inconsistency for the same logged-in account

Cross-site SSO is confirmed working (same session carries from one site to another with no re-login). But for the identical account, Denver Post rendered an actual photo avatar while Orlando Sentinel rendered a generated initials badge ("PA").

**Action needed:** Confirm whether this is a per-site fallback difference (e.g. photo failed to load/sync on one site) or a real bug.

**Status:** Open — not root-caused.

### 9.3 Reader Dashboard's own breakpoint convention differs from the marketing site's

The Reader Dashboard treats 1024×768 and 1280×960 as "menu always visible," a 1024px breakpoint — different from the audited 1039px rule on the main marketing-site nav. Since the Dashboard is a distinct web app from the shared marketing-site theme, this may be a legitimately different, real breakpoint rather than a conflict.

**Status:** Informational / low priority — flagged for awareness, not treated as an error.

### 9.4 Hidden duplicate nav `<li>` artifacts

On some categories (confirmed on Sports), the individual sub-section links (e.g. Chicago Bears, Bulls, Blackhawks, Cubs, White Sox) exist twice: once in the real working sub-menu, and again as `class="hidden"` top-level `<li>` siblings directly in the nav — apparent unused WordPress nav-menu artifacts.

**Status:** Open — worth a cleanup pass, low risk/low priority.

### 9.5 Device-class first-paint timing (Denver Post, mcall.com)

A device-signal CSS class is added client-side (confirmed not server-side) slightly later on Denver Post and mcall.com than the other 4 sites — likely real device detection working correctly, just applied a beat slower on those two.

**Action needed:** Worth asking engineering whether any component's CSS actually depends on this class being present at first paint. If nothing does, this needs no action.

**Status:** Open — low priority, likely closable with a single confirmation.

---

## 10. Color Tokens — Neutral gray scale (`color/gray/*`) mismatch

**Found:** 2026-09-10, CRUX Style Library color-token audit / production repertoire check (requested by Karl).

**Figma spec (source of truth):** the main file's `color/gray/100–600` (Colors collection):

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| `color/gray/100` | `#393938` |
| `color/gray/200` | `#5E5D5C` |
| `color/gray/300` | `#838280` |
| `color/gray/400` | `#A7A6A3` |
| `color/gray/500` | `#CCCAC7` |
| `color/gray/600` | `#F1EFEB` |

**Production:** every site in the repertoire ships its own `--site-branding-gray-100` through `--site-branding-gray-600` CSS custom properties, and all 6 sites use the identical (wrong) values:

| CSS custom property | Live value |
|---|---|
| `--site-branding-gray-100` | `#38322A` |
| `--site-branding-gray-200` | `#5D5B5A` |
| `--site-branding-gray-300` | `#9D9A98` |
| `--site-branding-gray-400` | `#AAA7A4` |
| `--site-branding-gray-500` | `#D7D6D2` |
| `--site-branding-gray-600` | `#F1EFEB` (matches the design system at this step only) |

**Sites verified (6/6 match, all identical):** ocregister.com, denverpost.com, chicagotribune.com, orlandosentinel.com, canoncitydailyrecord.com, mcall.com. Verified via a direct CSS custom-property scan of each site's live stylesheets (Claude in Chrome), not a screenshot/visual check.

**Note:** the live production values exactly match CRUX Style Library's `grayRoot/100–600` token set — a separate, seemingly superseded scale that isn't CRUX's own primary `color/gray/*` ramp either (CRUX's own `color/gray/*` matches the design system's values above exactly). It looks like production was built against an older/alternate gray ramp and was never updated when the design system's `color/gray/*` scale (consistent with CRUX's own `color/gray/*`) became canonical.

**Decision (Karl, 2026-09-10):** Use the design system's existing grays as the source of truth. CRUX's `grayRoot` scale was NOT added as a new token set — production should be corrected to match the existing `color/gray/*` values instead.

**Action needed:** Update each site's `--site-branding-gray-100` through `--site-branding-gray-600` custom properties to the design-system values in the table above.

**Status:** Open.

---

## 11. Color Tokens — Endless Tributes / Obituaries palette live-production audit

**Found:** 2026-09-10, live-production verification of the 9 documented Endless Tributes colors (Shared Platform Reference — Style Guide section, Endless Tributes — Style Guide sub-section, now migrated into MNG Design System's Color Pallets page) against denverpost.com's obituaries listing page and an obituary article subpage. Verified via Claude in Chrome: a `getComputedStyle()` scan of `backgroundColor`/`color`/`borderColor`/`boxShadow`/`fill` across all rendered DOM elements, plus a separate `document.styleSheets` rule-text scan (for rules not currently applied to any rendered element, and for actual `:hover`/`:active` pseudo-class declarations, since a synthetic `:hover` match after a simulated hover did not reliably surface them).

**Figma spec (Endless Tributes — Style Guide, 9 documented colors):**

| Token | Hex |
|---|---|
| Primary (Scarlet) | `#8d092d` |
| Primary-light | `#c00c3d` |
| Primary-lighter | `#f15f87` |
| Primary-dark | `#770000` |
| Primary-darker | `#4d0000` |
| Tan | `#a39c8a` |
| Tan-light | `#e8e6e2` |
| Secondary (Sage) | `#b3bc9c` |
| Tertiary (Brown) | `#3a252b` |

**Production findings (Denver Post obituaries listing + article page):**

- **Confirmed live matches (2):** Primary `#8d092d` — found. Tan `#a39c8a` — found, on the "Remove Filters" button.
- **Confirmed hover state (1):** Primary-light `#c00c3d` is not a static element color anywhere on the page, but is defined and applied as the `:hover` state of the Primary `#8d092d` button — a genuine match, just only visible on interaction rather than as a resting-state color.
- **Drifted (1):** Tan-light — Figma spec is `#e8e6e2`; the live production value is `#ecede7`. Close but not identical.
- **Fully absent from all loaded CSS (3):** Primary-lighter `#f15f87`, Primary-dark `#770000`, Primary-darker `#4d0000` — not found anywhere in computed styles or stylesheet rule text on the pages checked.
- **Defined in CSS but not rendered on the pages checked (2):** Secondary/Sage `#b3bc9c` (referenced as `--quaternary-obit`) and Tertiary/Brown `#3a252b` are both present as CSS variable declarations, but neither is applied to any visible element on Denver Post's `/obituaries` listing or the article subpage checked. Tertiary/Brown's rule is scoped to a `.obits-homepage-content` selector that isn't present on the pages checked — it may render on a different obituaries page (e.g. a dedicated homepage view) not covered by this pass.

**Obituaries Widget CSS variables (`--*-obit`) — live status:** all 5 (`--primary-obit`, `--primary-obit-light`, `--secondary-obit`, `--tertiary-obit`, `--quaternary-obit`) are still declared live at `:root` on Denver Post, despite being flagged "NEED TO REMOVE THESE FROM CODE" in the design documentation. Of the 5, only `--primary-obit` and `--primary-obit-light` are actually applied to visible elements; `--secondary-obit`, `--tertiary-obit`, and `--quaternary-obit` are declared but unused on the pages checked.

**Newly discovered, undocumented color:** `#ccc7bc` (a beige) — found live on two elements not accounted for in any of the existing Endless Tributes / Obituaries Widget documentation: the "Send Flowers" banner (`.obit-tribute-wrapper`) and the Guestbook "Post Your Message" submit button (`guestbook-form-submit`). Does not match any documented token.

**Note on scope:** only Denver Post was checked in this pass (Karl scoped the request to "any one" production site). The other 5 sites in the repertoire (ocregister.com, chicagotribune.com, orlandosentinel.com, canoncitydailyrecord.com, mcall.com) have not yet been checked for these colors.

**Figma action taken:** ~~none of these findings...~~ **Superseded 2026-09-10.** The original plan was to record these findings without adding them to Figma's Brand/Colors Variables groups, since MNG Design System's `Colors` collection only had a fixed 7-color-slot-per-theme model (`theme/primary`, `theme/secondary`, `theme/tertiary`, `theme/primary-light`, `theme/primary-dark`, `theme/primary-lighter`, `theme/primary-darker`) with no room for the Endless Tributes palette's 9 colors without restructuring all 20 modes. **Karl's resolution:** rather than trying to shoehorn the tributes palette into the existing per-theme slot model (or into its own one-off "Endless Tributes" mode), all 9 colors were added as a new, separate `color/tributes/*` variable group — `primary-lighter`, `primary-light`, `primary`, `primary-dark`, `primary-darker`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, `tan`, `tan-light` — each carrying the same universal value across all 20 modes (BoldCoastal, ModernEarthy, MeasuredVibrant, DenverPost, Endless Tributes, and all 15 masthead-specific modes). This matches how obituary pages actually render in production: identically regardless of which site's masthead brand is active, so a single shared value per token across every mode is correct, not a compromise. The `--*-obit` CSS widget variables (`--primary-obit`, `--primary-obit-light`, `--secondary-obit`, `--tertiary-obit`, `--quaternary-obit`) and the undocumented `#ccc7bc` beige are unaffected by this — the widget vars are a live-code cleanup item for engineering, and `#ccc7bc` remains genuinely undocumented (doesn't match any of the 9 tributes tokens), so both stay open below.

**Status:** Open for the `--*-obit` widget CSS variables (still live despite the "remove" flag) and the undocumented `#ccc7bc` beige. **Resolved 2026-09-10** for the tributes palette itself — all 9 colors are now proper Figma variables (`color/tributes/*`) applied across all 20 brand groups; the tan-light production drift (`#e8e6e2` spec vs. `#ecede7` live) is still an open engineering item to reconcile.

## 12. Ad Units — Homepage "Ad Blocks" slot after Blueconic/Most Popular is undersized (300×250 instead of 300×600)

**Found:** 2026-09-14, during the five-width (340/360/768/1024/1280) homepage production-parity audit.

**Figma action taken:** Per Karl's instruction, this ad instance was updated in Figma to the production-accurate `Cube 1 RRail ATF 300x600` block at every width where it appears (Mobile 340/360, and the new 768/Tablet build), replacing the previous `Cube Article 300x250` placeholder — specifically so the Figma mockups now make this gap visible rather than quietly matching the undersized code.

**Figma spec (now, post-fix):** `Cube 1 RRail ATF 300x600` — matches the size production is actually observed serving.

**Production:** Live GPT ad-slot scanning (`iframe[id^="google_ads_iframe"]` DOM query, cross-referenced against scroll position) on ocregister.com found this slot — `cube2_rrail_mid` — rendering at 300×600 at both mobile (340/360) and tablet (768) widths, at every width checked.

**Action needed:** Confirm whether the live implementation for this ad slot is intentionally 300×250 somewhere in code (unlikely, given production itself serves 300×600 into it) or whether this was simply never corrected after being built against an earlier/incorrect spec. Since Figma now shows the corrected 300×600 size, any remaining 300×250 assumption in the live templates should be treated as the bug to fix, not Figma.

**Status:** Open.

---

## 13. Masthead — Top-leaderboard ad slot renders at inconsistent sizes across page types

**Found:** 2026-09-15, during the Masthead breakpoint audit (`breakpoint-audit.md`), 375px (mobile) pass, comparing OC Register live production against the `Masthead` component set (WordPress Elements → Menus and Parts).

**Figma spec (as of this finding, before the Figma fix below):** The `Masthead` component's `Default`-state ad placement was inconsistent across `Page` variants — Home showed an ad box labeled "Top Leaderboard 320x100," while Section Front and Article showed no ad at all beneath the masthead.

**Production:** The same ad position (`div-gpt-ad-top_leaderboard`, directly below the masthead) renders at different sizes depending on page type, confirmed live at 375px width:

| Page | Live ad size |
|---|---|
| Home | 320×50 |
| Section Front (`/news/`) | 320×100 |
| Article | 320×50 |

**Decision (Karl, 2026-09-15):** This needs to be fixed in production so the top-leaderboard ad slot displays consistently. Figma has been updated (see below) to show the ad on all three page types at their live-measured sizes, so the intended placement is now visible as a reference for engineering.

**Figma action taken:** Added/corrected the ad placeholder on all three `Default`-state Page variants of the `Masthead` component (SM-Mobile tier): Home corrected to `Top Leaderboard 320x50` (was mislabeled 320x100), Section Front now shows `Top Leaderboard 320x100`, Article now shows `Top Leaderboard 320x50` — each matching what production actually serves at that page type.

**Action needed:** Engineering to reconcile the production-side inconsistency — confirm whether the top-leaderboard slot is intended to serve a uniform ad size across Home/Section Front/Article, and align production accordingly.

**Status:** Open.

---

## 14. Masthead — Top nav bar overflows its container at the 1040–1279px (Tier 4) breakpoint

**Found:** 2026-09-15, during the Masthead breakpoint audit (`breakpoint-audit.md`), XL-Desktop tier, comparing Chicago Tribune live production (one of the standing 6-site review list) against the `Masthead` component set (WordPress Elements → Menus and Parts).

**Production:** At 1040px width — the real breakpoint where the header switches to the full desktop nav — Chicago Tribune's top nav row (`.nav-primary`, 11 items: Business, Entertainment, Education, Immigration, Opinion, Politics, Sports, Suburbs, Chicago Magazine, Obituaries, BestReviews) does not fit within its container. The row's actual rendered width (1100.8px) is wider than its wrapper (973.75px). Because the page sets `overflow-x: hidden` on `<body>`, the row doesn't scroll into view — it's centered on the container and the overflow is simply clipped, cutting the first and last items off mid-word on both the left and right edges. No responsive fallback (smaller font, reduced spacing, wrapping, or item overflow menu) kicks in at this width.

Cross-checked against the standing 6-site list: Chicago Tribune and Orlando Sentinel both carry 11 top-nav items (the most of the 6 sites checked — OC Register 8, Denver Post 9, The Morning Call 10, Greeley Tribune 7), so this is the realistic worst case for how many items the nav needs to support, not an edge case.

**Figma spec (before this fix):** The `Masthead` component's top nav row was sized to fit neatly within its 1040px-wide container at whatever item count each page variant happened to have (7–10 items), with no representation of what happens once a site's real item count exceeds what the row can hold.

**Decision (Karl, 2026-09-15):** Build the Figma component to match production's actual (broken) treatment rather than hide the problem — the nav bar should visibly overflow and clip the same way Chicago Tribune's does, so the gap is obvious to anyone reviewing the component, and flag it here for engineering to fix in production.

**Figma action taken:** Brought all three `Default`-state Page variants (Home, Section Front, Article) of the XL-Desktop `Masthead` component up to 11 top-nav items each (added placeholder items to match Chicago Tribune's count), left the nav row at its natural/uncompressed content width (no longer force-fit to the container), and set the row's parent container to clip content at the component's 1040px bounds. The result: the nav row is centered and overflows past both edges, with the first and last items cut off mid-word — matching Chicago Tribune's live behavior.

**Action needed:** Engineering to add real responsive handling for the top nav at the 1040–1279px tier when the site's item count is high enough to overflow — options include a smaller font/tighter spacing at this tier, wrapping to a second line, or an overflow ("More") menu for items past what fits. Whatever the fix, it needs to apply platform-wide, not just to Chicago Tribune, since Orlando Sentinel hits the same 11-item count and any other site could grow into it.

**Addendum (2026-09-22):** The clipping isn't fully resolved even at the widest Desktop tier — while fixing an unrelated Masthead side-margin bug at 1024/1100 (WordPress Elements → Homepage, the homepage template audit §3.58, since retired), the same fixed-width `Top Nav` row (1322px) was found still clipped by ~21px per side at the full 1280px Desktop width, versus ~118.5px per side at 1100px. So this isn't strictly a "1040–1279px tier" problem that clears up at Desktop — it's a continuum that only becomes fully invisible somewhere above 1322px of available nav width. Doesn't change the action needed above, just widens the affected range engineering should account for.

**Status:** Open.

## 15. Masthead — Article scrolled-state headline overflows behind the bookmark/share icons

**Found:** 2026-09-15, during the Ad-Free Masthead audit (`breakpoint-audit.md`), 1100px pass, Article page, scrolled state, logged into an ad-free account.

**Production:** In the scrolled masthead on an article page, the breadcrumb + headline (`.article-title`, e.g. "National Politics | Judge blocks Kennedy Center board from putting…") renders at its full natural width based on the actual headline's length. The bookmark/save icon (`.saveArticleButton`) sits at a fixed horizontal position in the same row that does not account for how long the rendered headline actually is. For a headline long enough — this one included — the tail end of the headline text renders directly underneath the bookmark icon instead of stopping short of it, so the last few characters are visually obscured rather than cleanly truncated with an ellipsis.

Confirmed via DOM inspection at 1100px: the headline's own bounding box spans x 462–847px; the bookmark icon sits at x 778–809px — a 69px overlap.

**Also confirmed at 1040px** (2026-09-15, same Ad-Free audit pass, same article): the overlap is worse at this narrower width — headline box spans x 430–815px, bookmark icon sits at x 720–751px, a 95px overlap. Visually, the bookmark icon now sits directly on top of a word in the headline rather than just clipping the tail end.

**Also checked at 1728px** (2026-09-15, same audit pass, same article, Karl's full screen width): no overlap at all — the headline's container (`.entry-title`) correctly sizes down and its text box's right edge (x 1185px) sits 241px clear of the share widget's left edge (x 1426px).

**Root cause identified — this is a narrow-viewport layout bug, not a headline-length coincidence:**

| Width | Overlap |
|---|---|
| 1040px | 95px (worst) |
| 1100px | 69px |
| 1728px | none — 241px clearance |

The headline's flex/width allocation fails to shrink correctly relative to the fixed-width share-icon widget below some threshold between 1100px and 1728px — narrower windows make it worse, not better, which is the opposite of what a simple text-truncation gap would produce. This isn't tied to ad-free/logged-in state specifically — it would happen for any sufficiently long headline at a narrow-enough width regardless of login state — but was caught during the ad-free audit pass.

**Figma spec:** Not reproduced. Figma's Article `Scrolled` variant uses a fixed placeholder headline ("Roughly forty characters of the article t...") short enough that it doesn't hit this edge case, so the component itself doesn't currently demonstrate the bug. Unlike the Tier 4 top-nav overflow (entry #14, a systemic issue reproducible with any content at that width), this one only shows up in the narrower part of the desktop range, so it wasn't rebuilt into the static mock — it's flagged here for engineering instead.

**Action needed:** Give the headline element a max-width (or text-overflow: ellipsis truncation) tied to the actual available space before the bookmark/share-icon cluster at all desktop widths, not just the wider end of the range — the current layout only holds up above ~1700px.

**Status:** Open.

## 16. Masthead — Reader Dashboard shows the top nav-links row and "TRENDING:" bar, which the design explicitly excludes

**Found:** 2026-09-15, during the Reader Dashboard masthead audit (`breakpoint-audit.md`), on canoncitydailyrecord.com/dashboard/, logged in as a subscriber, at 1100px and 1040px (both above the masthead's 1039px desktop-nav threshold).

**Production:** At desktop widths, the Reader Dashboard's masthead renders the full top nav-links row (News / Local News / Sports / Things to Do / Opinion / Obituaries / Marketplace / On the Record / BestReviews) and a "TRENDING:" bar (e.g. "Fremont County Nonprofit Guide 2026," "Royal Gorge Living") above the breadcrumb and page content — the same two rows Home's masthead shows at this tier.

**Figma spec:** The `Masthead` component's `Device=XL-Desktop, Page=Dashboard` variant (`456:2715`, and the equivalent `Scrolled` variant `456:2840`) does **not** include a nav-links row or trending bar — it's just the top utility row (hamburger/All Sections, avatar, search) plus the weather/date/logo row, at 144px total versus Home's 497px 4-row structure.

**Decision (Karl, 2026-09-15):** Figma is correct — the Reader Dashboard should **not** display the trending bar or top navigation. What production shows at canoncitydailyrecord.com/dashboard/ is the bug, not a Figma gap. No Figma changes made.

**Action needed:** Engineering to suppress the nav-links row and "TRENDING:" bar on the Reader Dashboard page template at desktop widths, so it matches the intentionally-minimal masthead Figma already models.

**Note:** confirmed only on canoncitydailyrecord.com (the one site used for this phase, per Karl's direction) — not cross-checked against the other 5 repertoire sites.

**Status:** Open.

## 17. Video carousel ("Videos from @OCRegister") — fixed-height iframe leaves ~200px of unused blank space at narrow (340–360px) widths

**Found:** 2026-09-16, during a systematic 340px/360px breakpoint sweep across all homepage components (per Karl — checking widths narrower than any explicit CSS breakpoint, since 640px is the first real tier boundary). Verified twice: once via a narrowed real desktop Chrome window, and again via true mobile device emulation (Pixel 9 UA, touch-enabled, no desktop scrollbar) at both 340px and 360px, on ocregister.com.

**Production:** The `.dfm-page-middle-flex-container` block (a single Flourish-hosted `<iframe src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/21363813/embed" title="Video from @OCRegister">`) renders at a fixed height of 490px at both 340px and 360px viewport widths. At these widths the visible content inside the iframe — header ("Videos from @OCRegister"), subtitle, the row of video tiles, and the horizontal scroll-indicator bar — only fills roughly the top 260–265px of that height, leaving about 200px of blank white space below the scroll indicator before the next section (Photos) begins. Confirmed identically at both 340px and 360px, and identically whether tested via a narrowed desktop window or true mobile emulation, so this isn't a testing-methodology artifact — it's a real rendering behavior at these widths.

**Figma spec:** The `Videos from OCRegister Carousel` component (built 2026-09-16, see the homepage template audit section 3.35, since retired) sizes its outer frame to HUG its actual content height at every placed width — header + subtitle + tile row + scroll indicator, with no trailing blank space. It does not reproduce this gap, since the gap appears to be a property of the live Flourish embed's own fixed iframe height, not something the surrounding page template's CSS controls (no dedicated `@media` rules were found for `.dfm-page-middle-flex-container` itself in this or the earlier 3.2x-era investigation).

**Action needed:** Since the iframe height is most likely set via the Flourish visualisation's own embed configuration rather than page-template CSS, this is probably a Flourish-settings fix rather than a template fix — either make the embed size its iframe responsively to actual content height at narrow widths, or set a shorter fixed height specifically for the sub-640px range. Flagging for whoever owns the Flourish embed configuration to confirm whether that's adjustable there.

**Status:** Open.

## 18. Color Tokens — Greeley Tribune inherits three colors from the PMP override

**Found:** 2026-09-24, Prairie Mountain Publishing color audit (live check of all 19 PMP sites).

**Figma spec:** Colors collection, Greeley Tribune mode — `primary-lighter` `#708F9F`, `primary-darker` `#395B71`, `tertiary` `#FF5722`.

**Production:** greeleytribune.com's customizer (`div#page`) sets only `primary` `#536E7F`, `primary-light` `#5B7B8B` and `primary-dark` `#44687F`, and those match Figma. The other three steps are inherited from the PMP color override that every PMP site loads: `primary-lighter` `#47B6FF`, `primary-darker` `#171E44`, `tertiary` `#303F9F`.

**Action needed:** Decide whether Greeley should carry the Figma values for those three steps (engineering adds them to its customizer) or inherit the PMP values (design updates the Greeley mode to match).

**Decided 2026-09-25 (Karl):** neither. Greeley Tribune is a PMP site and has no color theme of its own. The Greeley Tribune Figma mode became Prairie Mountain Publishing, and the Greeley Tribune style guide was removed. PMP's should-be values are the Measured Vibrant values. That turns this entry around: greeleytribune.com's three `div#page` overrides are now the mismatch.

~~**Action needed now (engineering):** on greeleytribune.com, remove the `div#page` Customizer overrides…~~

**Updated 2026-09-30 (Karl):** Greeley's three `div#page` overrides (`--primary` `#536E7F`, `--primary-light` `#5B7B8B`, `--primary-dark` `#44687F`) are a **documented exception**, not a mismatch. They stay as they are. They're noted under the PMP style guide in Figma (no red outline) and carried as Greeley's site tokens in the export. Greeley only needs the two PMP-wide fixes in entry 21 (`primary-lighter`, `tertiary`).

**Status:** Resolved (exception documented). No engineering action for these three tokens.

## 19. Typography — headline tiers measured live with no matching Figma style

**Found:** 2026-08-27, live typography audit (recorded in a handoff note since retired). **Re-measured 2026-09-24** on ocregister, denverpost, chicagotribune, orlandosentinel, canoncitydailyrecord, mcall and greeleytribune. The values were identical on all 7.

**Production:**

| Role | Size | Weight | Line height | Letter spacing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Second-tier homepage card headline | 26px | 700 | 30.3px | -0.91 |
| Third-tier card headline | 20px | 700 | 23.6px | -0.4 |
| Fourth-tier card headline | 19px | 600 | 24px | -0.665 |
| Section Highlight headline list | 15px | 600 | 19px | -0.15 |
| Related ("More News") headline | 18px | 600 | 21px | normal |
| Body copy | 16.5px | 400 | 27px | -0.165 |
| Lead story, top of page | 29px | 700 | 32.8px | -0.87 |
| Lead story, media block | 29px | 700 | 33px | -1.16 |

**Also found:** on Bold Coastal the 19px and 15px headlines are Noto Sans, even though the theme's heading font is Noto Serif. The old Figma Title style used an averaged -1.0 letter spacing that matched neither lead-story variant.

**Resolved 2026-09-24 (design side):** added as Figma Editorial styles:
- `CardSecondary`, `CardTertiary`, `CardQuaternary`, `HeadlineList`, `RelatedHeadline`, `TitleMedia` and `Editorial/Body/Default`.
- A new theme token, `font/theme/small-headline-family`.
- Title's letter spacing corrected to -0.87.

See `tokens/typography/typography-tokens.md`. Production matches the new styles, so no engineering action is needed.

**Status:** Resolved.

## 20. Icon font — dead and duplicate glyphs to clean up, and two designed icons not yet in the font

**Found:** 2026-08-28 to 2026-08-31, icon font audit (`components/icons.md` §3, §5, §6). Added here 2026-09-25: `icons.md` said these were in this handoff, but they had never been logged.

**Figma spec (source of truth):** the `Icons` component set in the main MNG Design System file (node `4693:5`, 95 variants) and the documented icon list on its Icons page.

**Production (live icon font, checked on chicagotribune.com):**

| Item | What's wrong | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `google-plus` | Still in the live font. Google+ was shut down years ago, and the icon isn't documented. | Remove from the font. |
| `mng-podcast1` | Same codepoint (`e902`) as `android` — a font-build duplicate, not a separate icon. | Remove the alias. |
| `grid2` | Renders the same gift-box glyph as `gift2`, not a grid. The requested "grid" icon has not shipped. | Remove the alias; ship the real `grid` icon (artwork exists in Figma). |
| `notification-filled`, `notification-outlines` | Designed in Figma (filled and outline exclamation-in-a-circle alert icons) but missing from the live font under any name. Karl confirmed these are real, finished icons waiting to ship. | Add to the font. |

**Status:** Open.

## 21. Color Tokens — theme and sub-theme color fixes (every publication)

**Found:** 2026-08-03 production columns of the Color Pallets | 2026.09.10 style guides (PMP re-audited 2026-09-24, Hartford Courant verified 2026-09-25, NEPA and the disputed Tribune sites verified 2026-10-01). Logged here 2026-09-25, when every style guide's red-dashed production callouts were carried into the portable color files. The full per-theme list moved here from `tokens/colors/mng-colors-engineering-fixes.md` on 2026-09-30 (that file is retired).

**Figma spec (source of truth):** each theme's or sub-theme's should-be column on the Color Pallets page, and the matching Colors collection mode. Every row in the tables below is a red-dashed callout in that theme's "in Production" column. Fix production; don't change the tokens.

**How to read this:** find the publication in the index at the end of this entry, then go to its theme or sub-theme. Every site on that theme or sub-theme needs those fixes. Documented site exceptions are listed separately and need no fix. The same data is per publication in `tokens/colors/mng-colors-sites.csv` (`engineering_fixes` column) and `tokens/colors/mng-colors.tokens.json` (`$extensions.com.mng.mismatches`).

**Where to read colors live:** themed variables on `document.querySelector('#page')`, not `:root` (the Customizer override is scoped to `#page`; see the method note at the end of this doc).

**Most common gaps:** `--primary-lighter` isn't set on most themes (the page falls back to a shared default), and Measured Vibrant, its sub-themes and NEPA-PMP all render `--tertiary` as `#303F9F` instead of their design values.

**Status:** Open.

### Endless Tributes

Loads: `obituaries pages, identical on every site`. Figma mode: Endless Tributes.

> Shared obituaries palette. Production gaps are logged in entry 11.

### Documented exceptions (no fix needed)

These sites intentionally differ from their sub-theme. They are noted in Figma under the sub-theme's style guide without red outlines. Leave them as they are (see also entry 18).

#### Greeley Tribune (greeleytribune.com), under NEPA-PMP

| Token | NEPA-PMP value | Site value (keep) | Set in |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--primary` | `#3f51b5` | `#536e7f` | div#page Customizer override |
| `--primary-light` | `#5869ca` | `#5b7b8b` | div#page Customizer override |
| `--primary-dark` | `#32408f` | `#44687f` | div#page Customizer override |

It still needs the sub-theme fixes above for the tokens it doesn't override.

### Platform-wide (all publications)

- Universal grays: every site ships `--site-branding-gray-100…600` with the old CRUX `grayRoot` values. Change them to `color/gray/100…600`. See entry 10.
- Obituaries: `--*-obit` widget variables still live, tan-light drift (`#ecede7` vs `#e8e6e2`) and the undocumented `#ccc7bc`. See entry 11.

### Needs a live check before fixing

None. The sites whose theme was disputed (the 5 NEPA sites, Daily Press, The Morning Call, New York Daily News, GrowthSpotter) were verified live on 2026-10-01; see their notes in `tokens/colors/mng-colors-sites.csv`.

## 22. Spacing — 10px and 14px values off the 4/8 grid

**Found:** 2026-10-01, while creating the spacing tokens. Measured live on chicagotribune.com (homepage, 1728px viewport, every visible element's padding, margin and gap).

**Figma spec (source of truth):** spacing follows the 4/8 grid. The main file's "Spacing & Radius" collection has `spacing/050` 4, `spacing/100` 8, `spacing/150` 12, `spacing/200` 16, `spacing/250` 20, `spacing/300` 24.

**Decision (Karl, 2026-10-01):** 10px and 14px are production drift, not design values. They are not tokens; production should move to the nearest grid value.

**Production:**

| Where | Live value | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `.subscribe-button` (header, footer and article paywall CTA) | padding 14px / 10px | Use Button Primary Default: 16px / 20px (`spacing/200` / `spacing/250`). Same fix as entry 1. |
| Main content wrapper (left/right page gutter) | padding 0 10px | Use `spacing/100` (8px) or `spacing/150` (12px); confirm with design which one. |
| `ul.footer-menus`, `div.colophon` | padding 0 10px | Same as the page gutter. |

**Context:** on that page 10px appears 17 times. The grid values are far more common (16px 79, 12px 46, 32px 36, 8px 34, 4px 28). Other off-grid values also appear (15px 38, 17px 20, 19px 17, 3px 28) and should be reviewed in a later pass.

**Engineering patch (ready to apply):**

```css
/* 22a. Subscribe CTA = Button Primary Default (also closes entry 1) */
.subscribe-button {
  padding: 16px 20px;   /* was 14px 10px; spacing/200 vertical, spacing/250 horizontal */
  font-size: 14px;      /* was 15px */
}

/* 22b. Page gutter. GUTTER = 8px (spacing/100) or 12px (spacing/150), pending Karl */
.main-content-wrapper,   /* placeholder: the wrapper with padding: 0 10px today */
ul.footer-menus,
div.colophon {
  padding-left: GUTTER;  /* was 10px */
  padding-right: GUTTER; /* was 10px */
}
```

Check after the change: the subscribe CTA keeps its 44px min height and its fill color per masthead, and the header, body and footer edges still line up with each other.

**Status:** Open. 22a is ready for Engineering. 22b needs one design decision first (8px or 12px).

---

## 23. Radius — buttons are 4px; 5px on a button is drift

**Found:** 2026-10-01. Live check of chicagotribune.com and ocregister.com (homepage and article) and denverpost.com (homepage): every button uses 4px (Subscribe Now, newsletter Sign Up buttons). Figma's Button Primary, Secondary, Tertiary and Linkstyle were already 4px.

**Decision (Karl, 2026-10-01):** button radius is 4px across the board (`radius/sm`). In Figma, Action Button, Button Action and Button ActionMenu were changed from 5px to 4px, and every button shape is now bound to `radius/sm`. `radius/utility` (5px) stays, for containers only (Karl, 2026-10-01).

**Production:**

| Where | Live value | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Search submit button (`.search-button`, masthead search form; see `components/navigation.md`) | border-radius 5px | Use 4px (`radius/sm`). |
| Account dropdown panel (masthead; see `components/navigation.md`) | border-radius 0 0 5px 5px | No fix. It's a container, so 5px (`radius/utility`) is correct. |

**Containers keep 5px (`radius/utility`):** InLineMessage containers, ModalsCenter parts, Form Field shapes, check boxes, the status badge and the account dropdown. In Figma their 5px corners are bound to `radius/utility`.

**Engineering patch (ready to apply):**

```css
/* 23a. Masthead search submit = button radius */
.search-button {
  border-radius: 4px;   /* was 5px; radius/sm */
}
/* Leave the account dropdown at 0 0 5px 5px (radius/utility, container). */
```

**Status:** Open. Ready for Engineering.

## 24. Breaking News bar — Denver Post uses primary-lighter instead of secondary

**Found:** 2026-10-02, live check of the six review sites (theme CSS read on `#page`; no breaking bar was active, so the color was read from the site's own `.breaking-bar` rule).

**Figma spec (source of truth):** the Breaking News Banner (WordPress Elements, `506:5632`) background is `color/theme/secondary` and its text is `color/theme/near-black` (bound 2026-10-02).

**Production:**

| Site | `.breaking-bar` background | Text | Token |
|---|---|---|---|
| ocregister.com | #FFEA00 | #0A0908 | secondary |
| chicagotribune.com | #EEFF41 | #1F1E1C | secondary |
| orlandosentinel.com | #EEFF41 | #1F1E1C | secondary |
| canoncitydailyrecord.com | #EEFF41 | #141414 | secondary |
| mcall.com | #EEFF41 | #141414 | secondary |
| **denverpost.com** | **#AF1628** | #0A0908 | **primary-lighter** (Denver Post override) |

**Open question (Karl):** keep Denver Post's red bar as a documented Denver Post exception, or have Engineering align it to `secondary` (`#003459`, navy, on Denver Post). Until decided, Figma stays on `secondary`.

**Also noted:** Denver Post's live `--tertiary` is `#A13B1E`, but its token is `#FFC518`; and its live `--primary-light` / `--primary-lighter` (`#C81632` / `#AF1628`) are the reverse of the tokens (`#AF1628` / `#C81632`). Check these against entry 21's Denver Post section.

## 25. Sponsored content badge — needs to be fixed in production

**Found:** 2026-10-02, live check of the six review sites (homepage, Latest Headlines and article lists).

**Figma spec (source of truth):** the "Sponsored content" badge (WordPress Elements, Article Status Badge `Type=Sponsored`, `3344:63995`, and its instances in Latest Headlines, Top Zone and TopZone Article Card) stays **#7D161E with white text** (Karl, 2026-10-02). It is intentionally not bound to a theme token for now: none of the theme roles works on every site (white text fails contrast on the yellow `secondary` themes, and `tertiary` passes on only 9 of 22 themes).

**Production:** the live badge is the Nativo native-ad label (inline style set by the vendor template), not a theme class, and it doesn't match the design anywhere checked.

| Site | Live label background | Design | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| denverpost.com | #003459 (navy, white text) | #7D161E | ❌ |
| ocregister.com | #0097A7 | #7D161E | ❌ |
| chicagotribune.com, orlandosentinel.com, canoncitydailyrecord.com, mcall.com | no Nativo sponsored unit on the homepage checked | #7D161E | not checked |

**Fix:** update the Nativo sponsored-label template on every site to the design badge (#7D161E background, white `gray/max` text, Noto Sans), with Ad Ops. Re-check the other four sites when a sponsored unit is running.

**Note:** the theme's own `.sponsored-content .sponsored-flag` (a different element) uses `primary-light` with white text, and `secondary` with dark text on images.

## 26. Mobile adhesion — empty sticky bar shows at 1024px and up

**Found:** 2026-10-02, ocregister.com at a 1024px window (homepage and article page).

**Figma spec (source of truth):** `mobile_adhesion` exists only below 1024px — Ad Blocks `Mobile Adhesion 320x50` / `300x50` on mobile and `Mobile Adhesion 728x90` at tablet (768). The 1024, 1100 and 1280 templates have no adhesion unit (the 1024 floating anchor was removed 2026-10-02).

**Production:** at 1024px the `#mobile-adhesion` container is still fixed to the bottom of the viewport (1024×90, with its Close button), but the GPT slot has no valid size at that width (`getSizes(1024)` returns an empty list), so no ad can ever load. Readers see an empty bar.

**Fix:** hide the `#mobile-adhesion` container (and its Close button) at the same breakpoint where the slot's size mapping goes empty (≥1024px), or remove the container from the DOM at desktop widths. Check the other five review sites.

## 27. Blueconic Block (Most Popular) — list spacing and item headline

**Found:** 2026-10-07, ocregister.com at 360, 768, 1024, 1100 and 1280px (homepage "Most Popular", `.dfm-most-popular-flex-container` inside `landing-three-one` → `.three-one-left`).

**Figma spec (source of truth):** WordPress Elements `Blueconic Block (Most Popular)` (`3352:20526`) with `Most Popular List Item` (`3352:24171`) kept at **44px** tall per item. The space between items is added in the block (column auto-layout gap), not in the item.

### 27.1 Item spacing and column gaps

Production stacks the items with no gap. Each row is 60px tall for a one-line headline and 77px for two lines. Design keeps the item at 44px and adds the difference as the gap between items, so a one-line row lands on production's 60px.

| Width | Columns (production) | Design column gap | Design item gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| 360 (Mobile) | 1 × 340 | — | 16 (`spacing/200`) |
| 768 (Tablet) | 2 × 365 | 19 | 16 (`spacing/200`) |
| 1024 | 2 × 288 (every headline wraps to 2 lines) | 19 | 11 (fits the 77px two-line row) |
| 1100 | 2 × 360 | 21 | 16 (`spacing/200`) |
| 1280 | 2 × 459 | 22 | 16 (`spacing/200`) |

### 27.2 Spacing values with no token — remove in a future pass

The gaps of **11, 19, 21 and 22** px come from production's fluid layout and are kept in Figma as plain numbers on purpose. There are no tokens for them, and none should be created. When engineering moves these blocks onto the spacing scale (4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24), replace them: 11 → 12 (`spacing/150`), 19 / 21 → 20 (`spacing/250`), 22 → 24 (`spacing/300`) or 20, and update the Figma gaps to match. 16 and 20 are already bound to `spacing/200` / `spacing/250`.

### 27.3 Item headline type

| | Production (all widths) | Design (`Most Popular List Item`) |
|---|---|---|
| Headline | Noto Serif **600**, 16px / **17.07px** | Noto Serif **Bold (700)**, 16px / **auto (~22px)** |

One-line items are unaffected (the 44px height holds), but every extra line adds about 5px more in design than in production. Two-line rows are 66px plus the gap in design versus 77px in production, and three-line rows grow further apart. **Decision (Karl, 2026-10-07): keep the Figma item as is** — 44px tall, Noto Serif Bold 16 / auto. This is a known difference, not a Figma bug; production should move to the design's type if it's ever aligned.

## 28. Upcoming Events (CitySpark widget) — font family

**Found:** 2026-10-07, ocregister.com (homepage `.csLayHolder` → `.cswidholder` iframe, CitySpark template).

**Figma spec (source of truth):** WordPress Elements `Upcoming Events Widget` matches production's layout, sizes, spacing and colors exactly (Karl, 2026-10-07), but sets all text in **Noto Sans**, like the rest of the design system.

**Production:** every text element in the widget is **Roboto Condensed**: the title "Upcoming Events" 400 20/22, the "See All Events" and "Add your event" buttons 400 12/15, the card dates 400 11, event names 700 13/14, venues 400 12/14, date-strip days 400 15/20 uppercase and dates 400 20/19.

**Fix:** change the CitySpark widget template's font to Noto Sans (same sizes and weights) on every site, with whoever manages the CitySpark account.

## 29. Article breadcrumbs — label font family and text color

**Found:** 2026-10-08, ocregister.com article page (`.breadcrumbs` › `.breadcrumb-type-wrapper > a`, e.g. "NEWS › ENVIRONMENT • News").

**Figma spec (source of truth):** WordPress Elements › Article Page › `Breadcrumbs` (`1110:19469`) matches production's sizes, spacing and colors (rebuilt 2026-10-08, Karl): crumbs Noto Sans 700 16/22 uppercase, the `arrow-right2` icon at 14px in `color/gray/500` with 5px on each side, and the label " • News" in Noto Sans 400 15.2/15.2 (`font/size/15-2`). All breadcrumb text (crumbs, bullet and label) is **`color/gray/min` (#141414)** (Karl, 2026-10-08).

**Production:** the label and its CSS-added " • " bullet have no font family set, so they render in **Helvetica** (inherited from the page default). The crumbs are Noto Sans.

**Production:** all breadcrumb text (crumbs, bullet and label) is **#000000** (OC Register, Chicago Tribune, Orlando Sentinel; Denver Post's crumbs use its theme red #8E1024). The separator arrow is **#D7D6D2** on OC Register and Denver Post and **#C8C4C0** on Orlando Sentinel; design uses `color/gray/500` (#CCCAC7), the closest gray token. mcall.com and canoncitydailyrecord.com weren't checked (Chrome isn't allowed on those domains).

**Fix:** (1) set the label to Noto Sans (same 0.95em size, 400 weight) on every site; (2) change the breadcrumb text color from #000000 to #141414 (`color/gray/min`); (3) change the separator arrow from #D7D6D2 / #C8C4C0 to #CCCAC7 (`color/gray/500`) on every site.

**Status:** Open.

## How to use this doc

Add a new dated, numbered entry whenever a Figma-vs-production gap or an explicit engineering/legal flag is found during an audit, rather than quietly "fixing" the design tokens to match whatever production happens to do. Mark each item's status (Open / Fixed / Confirmed-intentional) as it gets resolved, and keep the original finding text rather than deleting it once resolved — see how `tokens/colors/color-tokens-decision-log.md` and the component audit docs annotate resolved items in place, for the pattern to follow here too.

**Method note for live color checks** (from a 2026-08-27 note, since retired): read themed CSS variables such as `--primary` on `document.querySelector('#page')`, not on `document.documentElement`. The WordPress Customizer's per-site override is scoped to `#page`, so reading at `:root` only shows the theme default. That mistake once produced a false drift finding on Modal and Disclosure.
